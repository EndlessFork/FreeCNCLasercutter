=== HW ===
  * laser alignment, cleaning of lens and mirrors
  * pause/unpause key
  * move z-dir/step to PORTF, use now free OCR3A for laser pulses
  * howto 'scan' the workpiece / display this as background in inkscape?

=== Firmware ===
  * choose G/M-code for pause/unpause
  * display remaining dwell time for G4
  * rework replys (Err/resend/OK) + update pysend.py
  * correct laser pulse timing for arcs
  * testsuite! (intermediate step: gen_tests.py)
  * rewrite kernels to compute only (saves arc-duplication)
  * support for software limits to crop movements (and disable laser)
  * reuse line/home kernel for homing? or combine line&move?
  * optimize muldiv and length2 (gcc is not nice here)
  * support arc for cases where X_STEPS_PER_M != Y_STEPS_PER_M
  * Fix Laser_CW for G2/G3 not working (pulsed works!)

=== SW ===
  * give pysend.py a GUI
  * cmdline options for pysend.py
  * provide a gcode lib for python (python2/3?)
  * optimize renderpicture.py ('fill' algo?)
  * relativize.py (transform coords to rel. moves)
  * optimize.py (reduze G0-pathlen)

=== workflow ===
  * inkscape plugin: new or rework one?
  * eagle-layouts: plugin? user-script?
  * GUI for arranging of gcode snippets? + sending gcode? + ETA-display
